Always celebrate the small wins. Building stuff with code is really cool. I never would have arrived where I’m at if I hadn’t stepped back and admired the awesome things I was building along the way.

Meet-ups are incredibly valuable. In the beginning, it was pretty intimidating to get myself to the point where I felt comfortable attending these. But once I did, I realized that there were a ton of developers just like me.

Avoiding merge conflicts makes you happier. Merge conflicts are annoying. So when I realized that I could sneak a feature in before a teammate so that he/she had to deal with these instead of me, I was super excited.
